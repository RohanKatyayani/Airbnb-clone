# WHY?

AirBnb is one of the most popular travel applications in the world. WHY? What does it do so different other than the idea of letting you live in someone's house instead of a hotel? 
To find answers to these questions, I had to understand the mechanism behind the application itself. I coded this entire application to build a base for all iOS/SwiftUI Developers 
and AI engineers to brainstorm and see how we can take this awesome idea forward by using Artificial Intelligence. Let's all come together and see how Traveling can be made more fun
and easier by taking this AirBnb like application to another level. 

Wire it up! And lemme know what you think ;)
