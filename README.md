# 🏡 Airbnb Clone in SwiftUI

Welcome to my **Airbnb Clone** project, built entirely with **SwiftUI**.  
This project is inspired by **Airbnb’s earlier UI design**—simple, intuitive, and effective.  
My goal was to understand the **architecture, flow, and structural design decisions** behind one of the most iconic travel apps.

> ⚠️ Note: This is **not a pixel-perfect clone** of the latest Airbnb UI.  
> It replicates the **base functionality and layout** from earlier versions to emphasize architectural clarity and learning.

## 🔍 Why I Built This

- To **deconstruct and understand** Airbnb's core product experience.
- To improve my **SwiftUI and iOS development skills** through real-world reverse engineering.
- To build a **base project for iOS and AI developers** to collaborate on.
- To explore how **AI can elevate the user experience** in travel applications.

## 💡 What’s Next?

This project is just the start. Here’s what I plan to explore next:

- 🧠 **AI-powered itinerary planning**
- 🗣️ **Conversational search with LLMs**
- 📍 **Smart, personalized recommendations**
- 🧳 **Voice-based travel assistant using GenAI**

Think of this as a sandbox for AI-infused travel innovation!
